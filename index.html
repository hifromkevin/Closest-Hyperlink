  <!--

    On a blank HTML page create 30 randomly positioned hyperlinks (text anchor tags). Each link should be a different word, so they are not all the same length. Now, when the mouse is clicked anywhere on the page, highlight the link that is closest to the mouse click.

    - Try and make your algorithm efficient enough that it can highlight the closet hyperlink when the mouse is moved instead of clicked.
    - Make sure to consider links that might overlap and highlight the one that is truly closer.
    - Feel free to display or log interesting data points such as mouse position, link position, etc…
    - Organize and comment your code so that it reflects your “production ready” style.
    - This doesn’t need to be hosted anywhere, you can deliver raw files if it is easier, or host it if you want.
